# elm-ui tutorial

After elm-mdl was deprecated I decided to give elm-ui a try.

Fortunally for me Alex S. Korban wrote a getting started article.

# Install Elm related tools

`npm i`

# Run the app

At any commit, you can run the app using: `npm run live`

You can then open the app on http://localhost:3000/
